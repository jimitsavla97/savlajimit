Group Project description : The project, Robot waiter service, was carried out by a group of six people under the supervision of Cranfield University and UVRobots. The project's goal was to have the robot transport cooked food and drinks from the kitchen to the table where the meal was placed.The Melodic version of Robotic Operating Software (ROS) was used to simulate the robot. We organised our tasks into specific phases using ROS, such as scanning the entire surroundings using a lidar sensor to create an environment map. The next phase was to upgrade the Uv robots' package for path planning, navigation, and mapping. In this assignment, my responsibility was to create waypoints on each table and a kitchen. The idea behind implementing waypoints was to direct the robot to a certain spot where the meal was supposed to be delivered using the RVIZ AND Gazebo softwares. The PDF in the attachment represents our two and a half month effort in which we successfully operated the robot waiter service.
Individual Thesis description: My thesis, titled "The development of a medical robot for automated ultrasound scan," was completed under the supervision of Cranfield University. The project's goal is to create a robot system capable of doing ultrasonic scans on human patients utilising a robot manipulator in accordance with machine vision. The thesis is separated into two parts: the first is about process simulation, and the second is about using machine vision to recognise landmarks. The simulation results in the files demonstrate the process of automated ultrasonic scan in which it will first go to the location of clicking the image with the help of camera connected at the top of the manipulator's end-effector. The following phase will be an ultrasound scan in the form of a pivotal scan. The folder contains two videos, the first of which displays the path generated and the second of which depicts the ultrasound scan procedure. The next folder contains the results of landmarks produced on the body, in which the robot will recognise the navel as a landmark and execute the ultrasonic scan depicted in the simulation phase. Landmarks were created using machine vision and the bounding box idea.
